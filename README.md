xtext-maven-example
===================

This project is outdated and only kept around for historic reasons. Since Xtext 2.9, the Xtext wizard generates a Maven build for you.

This is the accompanying material for my [blog post](http://mnmlst-dvlpr.blogspot.de/2014/08/building-xtext-languages-with-maven-and.html) on how to build Xtext languages with Maven and Gradle.

[Lorenzo Bettini](https://github.com/LorenzoBettini) has provided an additional example on how to use your language in the build of your language itself ("bootstrapping"). It is available on the "bootstrapping" branch
